# Course Project

The script for this project is fairly straight forward since I used only one. 

I begin with loading the data sets into R. Then I merged the training set and testing set into one data set along with 
the subjects data set.

Then I renamed the variables (columns) with the corresponding names from the features.txt data set. 

After that, I subsetted the data to get only the columns that were asked for. 

I also added a new variable in the y data set to include the descriptive activity labels along with the activity index for each 
individual subjects. 

Finally I created and saved the independent data set from the merged data set to reflect the objective of the assignment.
